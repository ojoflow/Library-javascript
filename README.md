# Library-javascript
The library project of The Odin Project!

I emphasized a clean and simple design. The 'new book' button opens a form that the user can input the data to create a new book card.

This was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I learned a lot about DOM manipulation, object management, array methods and event handlers. If I were to
come back and continue this project I might add theme changers or find a way to hook it up to an API to get bookcovers.
